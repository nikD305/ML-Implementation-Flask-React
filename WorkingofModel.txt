1)num1 num2 useState is created to store input and send it to backend for prediction

2)When the submit button is clicked handleSubmit() function will run 

3) and there it will fetch the localhost5000 and call the function predict from app.py

  i.e when it goes to the localhost5000/predict then automatically predict() will run

4) then  rating = predict_rating(num1, num2) here predict_rating() fucntion will call the predic.py
  by sending input , in predict.py will take input and send back the predicted value "rating",

and then this rating is sent back to App.js to display.
